# myFlashCard

A flash card app based on NodeJS. 

## Getting Started

The app is a copy of [this](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards) project, which I find it fun to write one with JS. Feel free to use it as you like.  BTW, use it in your local server, **don't deploy to a live server**.

### Prerequisites

*NodeJS* 
```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
install *mongodb* on the OS first, then: 
```
npm install mongodb --save
```


### Installing

Install the following in the myFlashCards's path: 

*ExpressJS* 
```
npm install --save express
```
*body-parser* 
```
npm install body-parser --save
```
*Vash*  
```
npm install vash --save
```

## Built With

## TODO list 

- [ ] Add a Home page to show cards information. 
- [ ] Card editing feature. 

I don't think I am interested in this project anymore. So, I suggest to DIY.
